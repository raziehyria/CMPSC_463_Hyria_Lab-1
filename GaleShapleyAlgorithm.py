GS Algorithm

Initialize each person to be free.
while (some man is free and hasn't proposed to every woman) {
    Choose such a man m
    w = 1st woman on m's list to whom m has not yet proposed
    if (w is free)
        assign m and w to be engaged
    else if (w prefers m to her fiancÃ© m')
        assign m and w to be engaged, and m' to be free
    else
        w rejects m

'''I was thinking of just adding two more list components to the dict and 
comparing the matches that way but im not sure if it would be more optimal'''
